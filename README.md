# Summary
This report focuses on how certain characteristics and habits of students may or may not influence a student's grades. Utilizing a dataset outlining a variety of personal, educational, and familial features of a student along with their final grade ranked from 0-7, our objective is to create a predictive model for student grades.  With this data in mind, we were able to tackle the following overarching research questions: as students, are our grades in our own control, (or are they predetermined by our circumstances i.e. gender), and which group of features is most influential on a student’s grade (options: personal, educational, or familial). The machine learning programs applied to the data included a random forest regressor (to understand which features are most important in determining a student's grade) and k-nearest neighbor classifiers (to determine which category of features bears the most influence on grades by comparing the accuracy of the classifiers when predicting student grade).
